# MVP Planning Assistant: System Design

## 1. System Overview

The MVP Planning Assistant is an interactive tool designed to guide users through the process of conceptualizing, planning, and documenting a Minimum Viable Product. The tool combines structured input collection with AI-powered suggestions to help users create comprehensive MVP plans, visualizations, presentations, and documentation.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 User Input Collection Module
- **Requirement Gathering Interface**: A conversational UI that prompts users for key information:
  - Project name and brief description
  - Target audience definition
  - Problem statement
  - Industry context
  - Initial feature ideas
  - Business goals and constraints
  - Technical limitations or preferences
  - Timeline expectations

- **Input Validation**: Logic to ensure all necessary information is collected before proceeding

### 2.2 Idea Exploration Engine
- **Guided Brainstorming Tool**: Framework for feature ideation based on industry context
- **Competitive Analysis Suggestions**: Automated recommendations for market research
- **Idea Validation Methods**: Templates for:
  - User surveys
  - Interview scripts
  - User testing protocols
  - Competitor comparison matrices

### 2.3 MVP Plan Generator
- **Feature Prioritization Algorithm**: Helps users rank features using RICE or MoSCoW methods
- **Timeline Creator**: Suggests realistic development timeframes based on complexity
- **KPI Recommendation Engine**: Suggests relevant metrics based on industry and goals
- **Resource Estimation Tool**: Provides rough estimates for development resources needed

### 2.4 Visual Content Generator
- **Flow Diagram Generator**: Creates user journey maps and process flows
- **UI/UX Mockup Suggestions**: Provides basic wireframe recommendations
- **PowerPoint Builder**: Assembles presentation based on collected inputs
- **README Document Creator**: Generates implementation documentation

### 2.5 Feedback and Iteration Module
- **Review Interface**: Allows users to comment on and request changes to all outputs
- **Version Tracking**: Maintains history of iterations and changes
- **Export Functionality**: Provides downloadable files in appropriate formats

## 3. User Journey

1. **Onboarding**:
   - User is welcomed and introduced to the tool
   - Brief explanation of the MVP planning process
   - Setting expectations for outputs

2. **Input Collection**:
   - Guided interview process collects all necessary information
   - System provides examples and suggestions throughout
   - Opportunity for users to refine and adjust inputs

3. **Plan Generation**:
   - System processes inputs and generates initial recommendations
   - Feature prioritization assistance
   - Timeline and resource estimation

4. **Visual Asset Creation**:
   - Generation of flow diagrams based on feature set
   - Assembly of PowerPoint presentation
   - Creation of README documentation

5. **Review and Refinement**:
   - User reviews all outputs
   - Feedback collection and implementation
   - Iterative improvements to all deliverables

6. **Final Delivery**:
   - Export of all assets in appropriate formats
   - Summary of next steps for implementation
   - Option to save project for future reference
