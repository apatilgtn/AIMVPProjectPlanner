USER FLOW DIAGRAM: This diagram illustrates the journey users take through the SkillLink platform. Starting at the landing page, users sign up and complete their profile setup by uploading a resume and selecting target job roles. The AI analyzes their skill gaps and presents a personalized dashboard. From there, users can explore different features including viewing their learning roadmap, browsing curated resources, tracking progress, taking skill certifications, and viewing job matches. Each of these paths allows users to take specific actions before returning to the dashboard, creating a hub-and-spoke design that keeps the dashboard as the central navigation point.\n\n2. DATA FLOW DIAGRAM: This diagram shows how data moves through the SkillLink system. User data flows through authentication, while resume data is parsed to extract skills. These extracted skills are compared against job requirements to generate a skill gap report. This report feeds into the learning path generator, which creates a personalized roadmap. The resource curator pulls from external APIs to provide relevant learning materials. User progress is tracked and can lead to certifications. Finally, the user's skill profile is matched against job listings to provide recommendations. The diagram clearly shows the transformation of raw user inputs into actionable insights and recommendations.\n\n3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM: This diagram presents the technical components that make up the SkillLink platform. The client layer consists of web and mobile applications that communicate with backend services through an API gateway. The backend is divided into microservices handling specific functions like authentication, skill analysis, learning path generation, etc. These services interact with databases storing user information, skills data, learning resources, and job listings. The system also connects to external services including course APIs, job boards, LinkedIn, and AI/ML services for advanced processing. The architecture follows a modern, scalable design with clear separation of concerns between different system components.","dataFlowDiagram":"flowchart LR\n    A[User Data] --> B[Authentication Service]\n    C[Resume Data] --> D[Resume Parser]\n    D --> E[Skills Extraction Engine]\n    F[Job Role Data] --> G[Job Requirements Database]\n    E --> H[Skill Gap Analyzer]\n    G --> H\n    H --> I[Skills Gap Report]\n    I --> J[Learning Path Generator]\n    J --> K[Personalized Learning Roadmap]\n    K --> L[Resource Curator]\n    M[External Resource APIs] --> L\n    L --> N[Curated Resources]\n    O[User Progress Data] --> P[Progress Tracker]\n    P --> Q[Progress Reports]\n    R[Assessment Results] --> S[Certification Generator]\n    S --> T[Skill Certifications]\n    U[User Skills Profile] --> V[Job Matching Engine]\n    W[Job Listings APIs] --> V\n    V --> X[Job Recommendations]","userFlowDiagram":"flowchart TB\n    A[Landing Page] --> B[Sign Up/Login]\n    B --> C[Profile Setup]\n    C --> D[Resume Upload]\n    D --> E[Select Target Job Roles]\n    E --> F[AI Skill Gap Analysis]\n    F --> G[Personalized Dashboard]\n    G --> H1[View Learning Roadmap]\n    G --> H2[Browse Curated Resources]\n    G --> H3[Track Progress]\n    G --> H4[Take Skill Certifications]\n    G --> H5[View Job Matches]\n    H1 --> I1[Select Learning Path]\n    H2 --> I2[Access External Resources]\n    H3 --> I3[Update Skills]\n    H4 --> I4[Complete Assessment]\n    H4 --> I5[Share Certification]\n    H5 --> I6[Apply to Jobs]\n    I1 --> G\n    I2 --> G\n    I3 --> G\n    I4 --> G\n    I5 --> G\n    I6 --> G","systemArchitectureDiagram":"flowchart TB\n    subgraph Client\n        A[Web Application]\n        B[Mobile App]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph API_Gateway\n        C[API Gateway/Load Balancer]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Backend_Services\n        D[Authentication Service]\n        E[User Profile Service]\n        F[Skill Analysis Service]\n        G[Learning Path Service]\n        H[Resource Curation Service]\n        I[Progress Tracking Service]\n        J[Certification Service]\n        K[Job Matching Service]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph Databases\n        L[(User DB)]\n        M[(Skills DB)]\n        N[(Resources DB)]\n        O[(Job Listings DB)]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph External_Services\n        P[Course APIs]\n        Q[Job Board APIs]\n        R[LinkedIn API]\n        S[AI/ML Services]\n    end\n    \n    A <--> C\n    B <--> C\n    C <--> D\n    C <--> E\n    C <--> F\n    C <--> G\n    C <--> H\n    C <--> I\n    C <--> J\n    C <--> K\n    \n    D <--> L\n    E <--> L\n    F <--> M\n    G <--> M\n    G <--> N\n    H <--> N\n    I <--> L\n    J <--> L\n    K <--> O\n    \n    H <--> P\n    K <--> Q\n    E <--> R\n    F <--> S\n    G <--> S"},"createdAt":"2025-05-04T05:54:57.554Z"},{"id":3,"projectId":null,"name":"SkillLink","industry":"EdTech, Professional Development, AI-powered Learning","audience":"University students, recent graduates, career changers, remote professionals","problemStatement":"Many individuals struggle to identify the exact skills required for specific job roles and lack personalized pathways to gain those skills.

USER FLOW DIAGRAM: This diagram illustrates how users navigate through SkillLink from registration to job matching. Users begin by creating an account, then upload their resume or connect their LinkedIn profile. They select target job roles, which triggers the skill gap analysis. Based on these gaps, they receive a personalized learning roadmap. The central hub is the dashboard, where users can access various features: browse learning resources, track progress, take assessments, earn badges, and view job recommendations. The flow shows how completing learning resources leads to progress tracking, with a decision point based on completion status, eventually leading to job recommendations.\n\n2. DATA FLOW DIAGRAM: This diagram shows how data flows through the SkillLink system. User data (from profiles, resumes, or LinkedIn) enters the skill parser to extract current skills. These are compared with skill requirements for target jobs in the gap analysis engine. The identified skill gaps feed into the roadmap generator, which references the learning resources database to create a personalized learning path. As users progress, the tracking system collects data that powers the dashboard, certification engine (for badges), and job matching algorithm, which also pulls from job listings to generate recommendations.\n\n3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM: This diagram presents SkillLink's technical architecture. The client application connects to the frontend layer, which interfaces with authentication services and the API gateway. The gateway routes requests to five microservices: user management, skill analysis, learning path, progress tracking, and job matching. The skill analysis, learning path, and job matching services leverage a shared AI/ML engine for intelligent processing. Each microservice has its own database. The system integrates with external APIs including LinkedIn (for profile import), job boards (for listings), and course providers (for learning resources).","dataFlowDiagram":"flowchart LR\n    User[User] --> UserData[(User Profile Data)]\n    Resume[Resume/LinkedIn] --> SkillParser[Skill Parser]\n    JobRoles[Job Roles Database] --> SkillReq[Skill Requirements]\n    SkillParser --> UserSkills[User Skills]\n    UserSkills --> GapAnalyzer[Gap Analysis Engine]\n    SkillReq --> GapAnalyzer\n    GapAnalyzer --> SkillGaps[Identified Skill Gaps]\n    SkillGaps --> Roadmap[Learning Roadmap Generator]\n    Resources[(Learning Resources DB)] --> Roadmap\n    Roadmap --> PersonalizedPath[Personalized Learning Path]\n    PersonalizedPath --> ProgressTracker[Progress Tracking System]\n    ProgressTracker --> ProgressData[(Progress Data)]\n    ProgressData --> Dashboard[User Dashboard]\n    ProgressData --> Certification[Certification Engine]\n    Certification --> Badges[Digital Badges]\n    ProgressData --> JobMatcher[Job Matching Algorithm]\n    JobListings[(Job Listings)] --> JobMatcher\n    JobMatcher --> Recommendations[Job Recommendations]","userFlowDiagram":"flowchart TB\n    Start([Start]) --> Register[Register/Login]\n    Register --> Upload[Upload Resume or Connect LinkedIn]\n    Upload --> SelectJob[Select Target Job Roles]\n    SelectJob --> SkillGap[View Skill Gap Analysis]\n    SkillGap --> RoadMap[Receive Personalized Learning Roadmap]\n    RoadMap --> Dashboard[Access Dashboard]\n    Dashboard --> Resources[Browse Learning Resources]\n    Dashboard --> Progress[Track Progress]\n    Dashboard --> Assessments[Take Skill Assessments]\n    Dashboard --> Badges[Earn Certification Badges]\n    Dashboard --> JobMatch[View Job Recommendations]\n    Resources --> Progress\n    Assessments --> Badges\n    Badges --> JobMatch\n    Progress --> A{Completed?}\n    A -->|Yes| JobMatch\n    A -->|No| Resources\n    JobMatch --> End([End])","systemArchitectureDiagram":"flowchart TB\n    Client[Client Browser/Mobile App] --> FE[Frontend Layer]\n    FE --> Auth[Authentication Service]\n    FE --> API[API Gateway]\n    API --> UserMS[User Management Service]\n    API --> SkillMS[Skill Analysis Service]\n    API --> LearnMS[Learning Path Service]\n    API --> ProgressMS[Progress Tracking Service]\n    API --> JobMS[Job Matching Service]\n    SkillMS --> AI[AI/ML Engine]\n    LearnMS --> AI\n    JobMS --> AI\n    UserMS --> UserDB[(User Database)]\n    SkillMS --> SkillDB[(Skills Database)]\n    LearnMS --> ResourceDB[(Learning Resources DB)]\n    ProgressMS --> ProgressDB[(Progress Database)]\n    JobMS --> JobDB[(Job Listings DB)]\n    AI --> ExternalAPI[External APIs]\n    ExternalAPI --> LinkedIn[LinkedIn API]\n    ExternalAPI --> JobBoards[Job Board APIs]\n    ExternalAPI --> CourseProviders[Course Provider APIs]"},"createdAt":"2025-05-04T07:33:28.525Z"},{"id":4,"projectId":null,"name":"EcoTrackr","industry":"Sustainability, Environmental Tech, Climate Action","audience":"Eco-conscious consumers, small businesses, sustainability consultants, schools","problemStatement":"People and small organizations want to reduce their environmental footprint but lack clear, easy-to-use tools to track and manage their daily carbon emissions or resource usage.\n\n","executiveSummary":"EcoTrackr is a user-friendly digital platform designed to help individuals and small organizations monitor and reduce their environmental impact through personalized carbon footprint tracking.
